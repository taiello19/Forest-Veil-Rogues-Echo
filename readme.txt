Welcome to Forest Veil: Rogue's Echo

This is a demo of the games combat which shows off that the game has a working combat system, there is a player and an enemy and a functioning cyclical combat loop.
In order to start this game all you have to do is run the game.py file.
Once the game opens, you are in the main menu where you can select your emotion(only one emotion for now)
Hit play and it will bring you into a sample combat scenario. Select cards(click the card again to unselect) and hit 'use' to use them, track your mana in the bottom left
aswell as your your draw and discard pile in bottom left and right corners respectively. 
Hit end turn when you are ready to end your turn. Exit the game via the X in the top corner at any time.

For this demo the general combat system is outlined, with attack and defense, further combat will consist of different enemy types
and different buffs/debuffs to the characters, all the base systems are in place so adjustments will come from tweaking numbers/decks/items
